# UE4_Cards_Gwent_Clone

this is a clone of Witcher 3 Gwent minigame, currently in Unreal C++ 4.26. 

It is reformatted for mobile, and uses Paragon images, but the logic is virtually identical to the original.

it's based on the original ActionScript 3 repository that was reversed engineered straight from Witcher 3.
